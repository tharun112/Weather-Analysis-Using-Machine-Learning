Weather Analysis Using Machine Learning

Our study looks into the actual approach that can be taken in analyzing features of the weather by applying machine learning like Neural Network[1] and statical approaches. The dataset contains 5320 records and it is characterized by, latitude and longitude, date and time, temperature in Â°C, relative humidity n %, precipitation in mm, and wind speed in km / h. Cleaning of the data was done using programming environments in python including pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib and all data was made correct and usable for analysis. Measurement and symptoms orientated measures were used to describe the results and these included mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values and quartiles.[2] It was noted that the given dataset has both quantitative and qualitative data formats, although quantitative data of weather was considered essential for further analysis. Overall, the memory usage of the dataset was pegged at about 249.5 KB. The current work covers all the aspects necessary to build upon the subsequent and further analysis and prediction of weather trends. This work shows how Python data management and analysis tools can be used to analyze and make sense of big data.
